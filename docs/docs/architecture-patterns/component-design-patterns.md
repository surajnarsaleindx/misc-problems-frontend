# Atomic Design Architecture

Our project adopts the Atomic Design methodology for organizing and building our components. This approach helps us create a more consistent, scalable, and maintainable codebase. Below is an overview of how our components are structured within this system.

## Atoms

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of our UI. They are small, reusable components that cannot be broken down further.

- **Examples**: Buttons, Input Fields, Labels, Icons.
- **Characteristics**: Highly reusable, abstract, and independent.
- **Location**: `src/components/atoms/`

## Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together. They are slightly more complex components that serve as the backbone of our UI.

- **Examples**: Form Fields (Label + Input), Search Bars (Input + Button), Menu Items.
- **Characteristics**: Reusable groups of atoms, serve as the building block for organisms.
- **Location**: `src/components/molecules/`

## Organisms

Organisms are complex UI components made of groups of molecules and atoms. They function as distinct sections of an interface.

- **Examples**: Header (Logo + Navigation Menu), Footer, Product Card.
- **Characteristics**: Complex, specific, and serve as standalone sections.
- **Location**: `src/components/organisms/`

## Templates

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and demonstrate the designâ€™s underlying content structure.

- **Examples**: Generic Page Layouts, Form Templates.
- **Characteristics**: Layout structure, placeholders for organisms and molecules.
- **Location**: `src/components/templates/`

## Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, components are given real content and turned into usable interfaces.

- **Examples**: Home Page, Contact Us Page, Dashboard.
- **Characteristics**: Actual implemented templates with real content and data.
- **Location**: `src/pages/`

## Conclusion

Understanding this structure is key to effectively working within our codebase. When creating new components, consider where they fit in the Atomic Design hierarchy. This ensures consistency and reusability across our project.

If you add a new category or make significant changes to the structure, please update this document accordingly.
