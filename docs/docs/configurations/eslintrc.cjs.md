# `.eslintrc.cjs`

## Overview

The `.eslintrc.cjs` file is the ESLint configuration file for our project. ESLint is a static code analysis tool used to identify problematic patterns in JavaScript code. Our configuration extends this functionality to TypeScript and React.

## Key Configurations

### Environment

- `env`: Specifies the environment in which the code runs. Our project is configured for browser and ES2020 environments.

### Extends

- `extends`: Array of base configurations that we extend. It includes:
  - `eslint:recommended`: The set of rules which are recommended by ESLint team.
  - `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`: Recommended rules from the TypeScript ESLint plugin.
  - `plugin:react-hooks/recommended`: Recommended rules for React Hooks.

### Parser

- `parser`: Specifies the parser to be used, `@typescript-eslint/parser` in our case, which allows ESLint to understand TypeScript.

### Plugins

- `plugins`: Defines additional plugins. We use the `react-refresh` plugin.

### Rules

- Custom rules are defined here. For example:
  - `react-refresh/only-export-components`: Warns if files that use react-refresh do not export components.
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: Warns against using the `any` type in TypeScript.

### Ignored Patterns

- `ignorePatterns`: Directories and files to be ignored by ESLint. In our project, `dist` and `.eslintrc.cjs` itself are ignored.

## Usage

This configuration ensures consistent coding practices across the project and helps in maintaining a clean and error-free codebase. Developers are encouraged to adhere to these rules and configure their IDEs to use this ESLint configuration for real-time linting and code quality checks.

Run `yarn lint` to run the these rules.
