# `package.json`

The `package.json` file in our React-Vite project serves as a manifest file for Node.js, containing metadata about the project. This file is central to the project's configuration and management of dependencies.

## Key Sections

### `name`, `private`, `version`, `type`

- `name`: "react-vite-template" - The name of our project.
- `private`: true - Prevents the project from being accidentally published to npm.
- `version`: "1.0.0" - The current version of the project.
- `type`: "module" - Specifies the module system (ECMAScript modules).

### `scripts`

Defines various scripts for project operations:

- `dev`: Runs the Vite development server.
- `build`: Compiles the project and then builds it using Vite.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint for code linting.
- `preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
- `format` & `format-check`: Runs Prettier for code formatting.
- `test` & `test:ui`: Executes tests using Vitest.

### `dependencies` & `devDependencies`

Lists all the runtime dependencies and development dependencies of the project, including React, MUI, Redux Toolkit, and various testing and building tools.

## Conclusion

Understanding `package.json` is crucial for managing dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. Always ensure that you're adding or updating dependencies appropriately for the project's needs.
